  Answer questions to get a personal action plan to deal with your legal problem.
  
  Step 1. Answer questions that will fill help build your action plan.  
  Step 2. Preview the action plan.  
  Step 3. Download and print your action plan.
  
  Tap the {green words} on any screen for a definition or more information.
  
  **Important:**
  Your action plan does not take the place of a lawyer.
  It is not advice and cannot tell you what you **should** do about your particular legal problem. It only lists things you may be able to do. Always speak with a lawyer, if you can.  See [Finding a lawyer](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm).

  For some cases, you can choose your court.
  % if user_role=='plaintiff':    
  How do you know which court to choose?
  
  The District Court and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
  any type of case. Housing, Probate and Family and Juvenile Court are
    **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
  They have judges with special training as well as special 
  resources available.
  
  Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
  can give you every kind of help. For example, you can only
  ask for visitation in the Probate and Family Court. Only
  the Housing Court or Superior Court can hear discrimination
  cases.
  
  Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
  your address. There are many district courts all over the state,
  but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
  courts.
  
  Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
  as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
  
  Only you know the right choice.
  
  % else:
  If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
  get to choose your court. Select the court that is already
  listed on your court paperwork.
