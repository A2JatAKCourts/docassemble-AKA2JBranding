  Step ${ respond_to_reconsider_idx }: If the court asks, respond in writing to the Motion to Reconsider
content: |
  A <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> asks a judge to change a decision or order they made in the last 10 days.
  <ul>
  <li>Do not respond to a <strong>Motion to reconsider</strong> unless the court asks you for a response, usually in a written order or notice. The court usually sets a deadline for a response. If no deadline is set, the response is due 10 days from the date the court distributed it to you. You can find this date by looking at the end of the written order or decision to see when the clerk emailed or mailed it to the parents.</li>
  <li>There will not be a hearing.</li>
  <li>The court may write a decision, but if the court does not issue a decision 30 days after the motion or response was filed, <strong>whichever is later</strong>, the <strong>Motion to reconsider</strong> is denied, which means the original decision is not changed.</li>
  <li>If the court grants the a <strong>Motion to reconsider</strong>, it will either enter a new order or ask both sides for more information.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">If the court asks for a response</div>
  <p>If the court asks for a response, provide the information the court asks for. You will have 10 days to file your response unless the court gives you a different deadline. Fill out:</p>

  An appeal is the way to ask the Alaska Supreme Court to review the trial judge’s decision in your case. It is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information.  In an appeal you argue that the trial judge made a legal mistake.  The civil appeals process is complicated, long and expensive. The process can take more than 2 years. [Talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsresources.htm#1), if you can.
  
  The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:
  
  * the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * the documents in the lower court or agency record, and
  * appeal briefs filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court.
  
  % if respond_to_appeal == 'agree':
  The Alaska Court System </a><a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appeals.htm">Appeals</a> web pages have a lot of information about the process. You can also review a <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/docs/SHS_AP_1000.pdf">timeline for the steps in an appeal</a>.
  <div class="step-subheading">Agreement</div>
  If you agree with what the other parent is asking for in the appeal, you have some options.
  <ul>
  <li>Contact the other parent and write out your agreement. See Step ${ appeal_contact_parent_idx }.</li>
  <li>Tell the Alaska Supreme Court in writing you will not be a part of the appeal. See Step ${ tell_supreme_court_idx }.</li>

  <div class="step-subheading">Process</div>
  If you receive papers saying the other parent filed an appeal, you need to prepare to respond. There are several times during the appeal that you need to be active:
  <ul>
  <li>after receiving the papers from the other parent that start the appeal;</li>
  <li>when deciding whether to file your own appeal too which is called a "cross appeal;"</li>
  <li>when writing a response called a brief to the other parent's opening brief (written argument why the trial court decision should be changed); and</li>
  <li>when preparing for oral argument where both sides appear in the <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsglossary.htm#supremecourt">Supreme Court</a> and each side argues their case and the <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsglossary.htm#justice">justices</a> may ask questions.</li>
