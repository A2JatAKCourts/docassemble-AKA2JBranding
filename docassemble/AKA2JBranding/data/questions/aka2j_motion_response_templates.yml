  Step ${ respond_to_reconsider_idx }: If the court asks, respond in writing to the Motion to Reconsider
content: |
  A <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> asks a judge to change a decision or order they made in the last 10 days.
  <ul>
  <li>Do not respond to a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> unless the court asks you for a response, usually in a written order or notice. The court usually sets a deadline for a response. If no deadline is set, the response is due 10 days from the date the court distributed it to you. You can find this date by looking at the end of the written order or decision to see when the clerk emailed or mailed it to the parents.</li>
  <li>There will not be a hearing.</li>
  <li>The court may write a decision, but if the court does not issue a decision 30 days after the motion or response was filed, <strong>whichever is later</strong>, the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> is denied, which means the original decision is not changed.</li>
  <li>If the court grants the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong>, it will either enter a new order or ask both sides for more information.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">If the court asks for a response</div>
  <p>If the court asks for a response, provide the information the court asks for. You will have 10 days to file your response unless the court gives you a different deadline. Fill out:</p>
