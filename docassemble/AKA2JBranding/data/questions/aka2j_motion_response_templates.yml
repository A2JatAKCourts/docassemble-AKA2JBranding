  Step ${ respond_to_reconsider_idx }: If the court asks, respond in writing to the Motion to Reconsider
content: |
  A <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> asks a judge to change a decision or order they made in the last 10 days.
  <ul>
  <li>Do not respond to a <strong>Motion to reconsider</strong> unless the court asks you for a response, usually in a written order or notice. The court usually sets a deadline for a response. If no deadline is set, the response is due 10 days from the date the court distributed it to you. You can find this date by looking at the end of the written order or decision to see when the clerk emailed or mailed it to the parents.</li>
  <li>There will not be a hearing.</li>
  <li>The court may write a decision, but if the court does not issue a decision 30 days after the motion or response was filed, <strong>whichever is later</strong>, the <strong>Motion to reconsider</strong> is denied, which means the original decision is not changed.</li>
  <li>If the court grants the a <strong>Motion to reconsider</strong>, it will either enter a new order or ask both sides for more information.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">If the court asks for a response</div>
  <p>If the court asks for a response, provide the information the court asks for. You will have 10 days to file your response unless the court gives you a different deadline. Fill out:</p>

  **For custody**, a change in circumstances means something has happened so that the old parenting plan is no longer in the children's best interest. Examples include:

  * The original plan was for an infant and now the child is 5 years old and will start kindergarten so the old schedule of 10 am exchanges does not work.
  * One parent is moving out of state so the existing schedule of week on / week off is impossible.
  * The parent the children were living with 4 days a week went to jail, so the existing schedule is impossible.
  * An act of domestic violence between the parents when returning the children.
  % endif
  % if type_of_response in('custody','child support','all divorce'):
  
  **For child support**, there needs to be:

  * A 15% change in the amount of child support ordered. So that when you calculate support based on the parents' current income, the amount is 15% more or less than the current support order.

  **Or**

  * A change in the parenting plan that affects the child support formula. For example, changing from a primary custody to shared custody plan will probably change the amount of child support. The [FAQs on the court's Child Support webpages](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/supportfaq.htm) help you decide if you want to file a **Motion to Modify Child Support**.

  An appeal is the way to ask the Alaska Supreme Court to review the trial judge’s decision in your case. It is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information.  In an appeal you argue that the trial judge made a legal mistake.  The civil appeals process is complicated, long and expensive. The process can take more than 2 years. [Talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsresources.htm#1), if you can.
  
  The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:
  
  * the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * the documents in the lower court or agency record, and
  * appeal briefs filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court.
  
  % if respond_to_appeal == 'agree':
  The Alaska Court System </a><a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appeals.htm">Appeals</a> web pages have a lot of information about the process. You can also review a <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/docs/SHS_AP_1000.pdf">timeline for the steps in an appeal</a>.
  <div class="step-subheading">Agreement</div>
  If you agree with what ${ other_party_in_case } is asking for in the appeal, you have some options.
  <ul>
  <li>Contact ${ other_party_in_case } and write out your agreement. See Step ${ appeal_contact_parent_idx }.</li>

  <div class="step-subheading">Process</div>
  If you receive papers saying ${ other_party_in_case } filed an appeal, you need to prepare to respond. There are several times during the appeal that you need to be active:
  <ul>
  <li>after receiving the papers from ${ other_party_in_case } that start the appeal;</li>
  <li>when deciding whether to file your own appeal too which is called a "cross appeal;"</li>
  <li>when writing a response called a brief to ${ other_party_in_case }'s opening brief (written argument why the trial court decision should be changed); and</li>
  <li>when preparing for oral argument where both sides appear in the <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsglossary.htm#supremecourt">Supreme Court</a> and each side argues their case and the <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsglossary.htm#justice">justices</a> may ask questions.</li>
