You can find this date by looking at the end of the written order or decision to see when the clerk emailed or mailed it to the parents.</li>
  <li>There will not be a hearing.</li>
  <li>The court may write a decision, but if the court does not issue a decision 30 days after the motion or response was filed, <strong>whichever is later</strong>, the <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong> is denied, which means the original decision is not changed.</li>
  <li>If the court grants the a <strong>Motion for Reconsideration</strong>, it will either enter a new order or ask both sides for more information.</li>

  <p>If you served ${ other_party_in_case } with your response: 
  <ul>
  <li>by hand-delivery, email, or TrueFile, they have 5 days to reply to the court in writing,</li> 
  <li>by mail, they have 8 days.</li>

  After the deadlines for response and reply have passed, the judge decides the motion. If the judge believes a hearing is necessary before they decide the motion, the court schedules a hearing.
  
  The court will notify you of:
  * the time, 
  * date and 
  * location of the hearing. 
  Also they will probably, tell you if the hearing will be an "evidentiary hearing" followed by "oral argument" or just "oral argument":
  <ul>
  <li>At an "evidentiary hearing," ${ other_party_in_case } must prove their reasons mean the judge should agree to the order the motion asks for.  ${ capitalize(other_party_in_case) } must present evidence, which may include their own testimony or other witnesses' testimony. <br>
  You may present similar evidence for points where you disagree.</li>
  <li>At "oral argument," each of you explains what you want and answer any questions the judge might have. No further testimony or witnesses are presented.</li>
