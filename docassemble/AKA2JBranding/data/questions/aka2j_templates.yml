  Step ${ parents_agree_idx }: Find out if you and ${ other_other_party_in_your_case } agree
content: |
  <p>If you want to change an order in your ${ case_type } case, you can talk with ${ other_other_party_in_your_case }. See if you agree about the change or if you both want to try to reach an agreement in one of these ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk more with each other until you can agree.</li>
    <li>Mediation.</li>
    <li>Collaborative Law.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk with ${ other_other_party_in_your_case } about settling your case without a trial</div>
  <p>Some people are able to talk to each other and agree about the issues they need to work out. They do not need a judge to decide for them. Sometimes a friend or family member can help you figure out an agreement.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  <p>Mediation is an informal, voluntary, and confidential way   to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone   else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.</li>
    <li>Explain and understand each other's needs.</li>
    <li>Clear up misunderstandings.</li>
    <li>Explore creative solutions. And</li>
    <li>Reach acceptable agreements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.  <br>
    <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation">Read about mediation</a>.</p>
    
  <div class="step-subheading">Collaborative Law</div>
  <p>The Alaska Association of Collaborative Professionals helps people resolve parenting issues outside of the court process without a judge making decisions.  Learn more about the <a href="https://www.alaskacollaborative.org">Association</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="step-subheading">If you both agree, you can change things on your own.</div>
    <p>Whether or not you must tell the court depends on the type of change you make.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you make a minor change, such as changing a pick-up time by an hour, or a change to the holiday schedule, you do not have   to tell the court.</li>
    <li>If you make a change about something big, like changing the parenting schedule from weekends with one parent to week on / week   off, tell the court in writing.</li>
    <li>If you want to be sure you are both bound by the   new agreement, tell the court in writing so the judge can make the agreement   part of the court order in your case.</li>
    <li>If you want to change child support because   either the parenting schedule or a parent's income changes, you should always   tell the court in writing so the judge can decide whether the child support   amount should change.  The parent who   owes money under the child support order you want to change will continues to owe that amount until the judge signs a new order.</li>
  </ul>

  Step ${ learn_reconsider_idx }: Learn about Motions to Reconsider
content: |
  <p>To ask your trial judge to reconsider a  decision, file a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong></p>
  <p>You have only 10 days after the date the  court sent your child support order to you. </p>
  <p>Look at the last page of the order. The date to count from is in the box at the bottom of the page. It looks something like this.</p>
  
  % for image_data in distribution_certificate_list:
  ${ image_data['text'] }
  ${ image_data['image'].show(width='100%') }
  % endfor
  
  <p> If the 10th day is a  weekend or holiday, your motion is due the next day the court is open. For example, if the 10th day is a Saturday,  and the court is open Monday, your motion is due Monday. If Monday is a holiday, your motion is due Tuesday.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>You can ask a judge to reconsider  their decision for 4 reasons </div>
  <ol>
    <li>The judge overlooked, misapplied or failed to  consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. This means the  judge made a mistake when they applied the law in your case.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rule 90.3 states that if a child spends at least  256 nights with one parent, that parent has primary custody and the other  parent pays 20% of their adjusted annual  income for child support to the parent the child lives with.</li>
        <li>If the judge used 27% of adjusted income instead  of 20%, the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge misapplied Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived some  material fact or proposition of law. This means the judge got an important fact  wrong.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The parents agree that mom makes $25,000 every  year. They file the forms to tell the judge they agree. The judge calculated  child support using $35,000 for mom's income. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge used the wrong income to calculate  child support.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived a material  question in the case. This means the judge misunderstood what you were asking for.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A child changed from living full time with their  mom to living full time with their dad. Under the child support formula, dad  used to pay child support to mom based on the primary custody child support  calculation. Now, mom should pay child support to dad based on the primary  custody child support calculation. Dad filed a motion to modify child support.  The judge denied dad's motion because the parents' incomes did not change.  </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state the judge did not include the changed parenting  schedule in the child support calculation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later  court decision or statute. This means the judge used a rule or law that  changed.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>On April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to  allow a parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their  gross income, up to 10% of the parent's gross income.</li>
        <li>If the judge calculated child support on April  14 and did not subtract the cost of the parent's health insurance, the Motion  to Reconsider would explain the cost of the parent's health insurance and state  that Civil Rule 90.3 changed on April 15, 2018.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>See <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf">Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure</a> 77(k) to read the court rules about the <strong>4 reasons</strong> you can ask the court to reconsider a judge's decision:</p>

    <li>You can file within a &quot;reasonable  time&quot; after the date the court sent your child support order to you. For any of the first 3 reasons in Civil Rule  60(b), you must file within <strong>1 year</strong> of the date the court sent the order to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The date the court sent the order to you is at the bottom of the last page of your order.</p>
  
  % for image_data in distribution_certificate_list:
  ${ image_data['text'] }
  ${ image_data['image'].show(width='100%') }
  % endfor

  <p>Act quickly! The judge defines"reasonable" and "in a reasonable time". The judge  may refuse to set aside the order if you file <strong>after</strong> a "reasonable time" has passed, even if your reason  for filing is a good one.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Reasons you may file a Motion to Set Aside  Judgment or Order</div>
  <p><strong>Civil Rule 60(a)</strong> <br>
    The  court made a clerical mistake or accidentally left something out of a document. </p>
  <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The order has the wrong birthday for one of your  children. Or</li>
    <li>The order was sent to both parents on January 4, <strong>2023</strong>, but the date on the order is  January 4, <strong>2022</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Civil  Rule 60(b)</strong></p>
  <p>The court made a mistake listed below.</p>
  <p>For the first 3 types of mistake, you must file your <strong>Motion to Set Aside</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Within <strong>1 year</strong> of the date the court sent  the order to you, <strong>and</strong></li>
    <li>The amount of time before you file must be  &quot;reasonable."</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Inadvertence,  surprise or excusable neglect:
      <ul>
        <li>A parent made a mistake or did not pay close  attention -inadvertence,</li>
        <li>An unexpected action, sudden confusion or an  unanticipated event - surprise, or </li>
        <li>A legitimate excuse for failing to take required  action - excusable neglect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>You ask the judge to set aside the decision  made at a hearing you missed because: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You had a heart attack the day before, and </li>
        <li>You were in the ICU, so you could not attend.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Newly  discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by taking reasonable  steps within the 10 days allowed to request a new trial.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gave your spouse $1,000 before the trial to pay the property  taxes on your marital home, and</li>
        <li>1 month after trial you learn your spouse did not pay the taxes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fraud,  misrepresentation, or other misconduct from the other side.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>One spouse forges an appraisal of the marital home and uses it as  evidence at the divorce trial to argue the value of the house.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For  the next 3 types of mistake, the amount of time before you file must be  &quot;reasonable."</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The judgment is  void.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>An Alaska court generally does not have the authority or &quot;jurisdiction&quot; to make a parenting  plan for a child who has lived in another state for the past 6 or more  months. </li>
        <li>If a child was living in Oregon for 6 months before the divorce  case started, and</li>
        <li>A parent hid this detail from the other parent and the court, </li>
        <li>The parenting plan order would be void because the court did not  have jurisdiction to decide the parenting plan.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judgment has been satisfied, released or  discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or  otherwise vacated or it is no longer fair that the judgment should apply at  this time.
      <p><strong>For  example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The court orders a parent to pay child support. The child files  for Emancipation and the judge grants it. Parents do not have to support their  emancipated child. The child support judgment   would be released or discharged.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Any  other reason justifying relief from the judgment.
      <ul>
        <li> You may be able to come up with a different good reason the judge should  start the case over again. But your reason cannot be any of the 6 listed above – it must be  something different.</li>
      </ul>

  Step ${ appeal_idx }: Decide if you want to file an appeal
content: |
  An appeal is the way to ask the Alaska Supreme Court to review the trial judge’s decision in your case. It is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information.  In an appeal you argue that the trial judge made a legal mistake.  The civil appeals process is complicated, long and expensive. The process can take more than 2 years. [Talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsresources.htm#1), if you can.
  
  The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:
  
  * the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * the documents in the lower court or agency record, and
  * appeal briefs filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court. 
  
  To start an appeal, you must pay:
  
  * a $250 filing fee,
  * a $750 bond or deposit for costs, and
  * other costs like paying someone to make a transcript of your trial.
  
  If you cannot afford the cost of filing an Appeal, you can use **Motion for Waiver of Filing Fees and Costs, [SHS-AP 130](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/docs/SHS_AP_130.doc)** to ask the court to waive the filing fee and costs.

  Step ${ expect_reconsider_idx }: What to expect after you file a Motion to Reconsider 
content: |
  <p>A <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> is different from other motions.</p>
  <p>${ capitalize(other_party_in_case) } does not have to respond unless the judge sends a notice and asks ${ other_party_in_case } to respond in writing.</p>
  <p> If the judge agrees to reconsider their decision, they may ask ${ other_party_in_case } to respond in writing or they may change the decision. Usually, the judge only changes their  decision after they ask ${ other_party_in_case } for a written response.</p>
  <p>If the judge does nothing for 30 days, it  means the judge is not going to grant your <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong>. You will not get anything in writing</a>. The original decision is not changed.</p>
  <p>The 30 days starts when  you file your <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong>.  If the judge asks ${ other_party_in_case } to respond in writing, the 30 days starts  over when ${ other_party_in_case } files their written response.</p>
