content: |
  <p>If you want to change an order in your ${ case_type } case, you can talk with ${ other_party_in_case }. See if you agree about the change or if you both want to try to reach an agreement one of these ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk more with each other until you can agree.</li>
    <li>Mediation.</li>
    <li>Collaborative Law.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk with ${ other_party_in_case } about settling your case without a trial</div>
  <p>Some people are able to talk to each other and agree about the issues they need to work out. They do not need a judge to decide for them. Sometimes a friend or family member can help you figure out an agreement.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  <p>Mediation is an informal, voluntary, and confidential way   to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone   else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.</li>
    <li>Explain and understand each other's needs.</li>
    <li>Clear up misunderstandings.</li>
    <li>Explore creative solutions. And</li>
    <li>Reach acceptable agreements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.  <br>
    <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation">Read about mediation</a>.</p>
    
  <div class="step-subheading">Collaborative Law</div>
  <p>The <strong>Alaska Association of Collaborative Professionals</strong> helps people resolve parenting issues outside of the court process without a judge making decisions.  Learn more about the Association on <a href="https://www.alaskacollaborative.org">their website</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="step-subheading">If you both agree, you can change some things on your own</div>
  <ul>
    <li>You do not have to tell the court about every change you make. But you must tell the court about <strong>some</strong> changes. If you make a small change, like changing pick-up time by an hour, or a change to your holiday schedule, you do not have to tell the court.</li>
    <li>If you make a change about something big, like changing the parenting schedule from weekends with one parent to week on / week off, you must tell the court in writing.</li>
    <li>If you want to be sure that both of you must follow the new agreement, tell the court so the judge can make the agreement part of your court order.</li>
    <li>If you want to change child support because the parenting schedule or a parent's income changes, you must tell the court in writing so the judge can decide if the child support amount should change.  The parent who owes money under the child support order you want to change continues to owe that amount until the judge signs a new order.</li>

  <p>To ask your judge to reconsider a decision, file a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong></p>
  <p>You have only 10 days after the date the court sent your ${ case_type } order to you. </p>
  <p>Look at the last page of the order. The date to count from is in the box at the bottom of the page. It looks something like this.</p>

  <p> If the <strong>10th</strong> day is a  weekend or holiday, your motion is due the next day the court is open. For example, if the 10th day is a Saturday,  and the court is open Monday, your motion is due Monday. If Monday is a holiday, your motion is due Tuesday.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>You can ask a judge to reconsider their decision for 4 reasons</div>
  <ol>
    <li>The judge overlooked, misapplied or failed to  consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. This means the  judge made a mistake when they applied the law in your case.
      <p class = "example">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rule 90.3 states that if a child spends at least  256 nights with one parent, that parent has primary custody and the other  parent pays 20% of their adjusted annual  income for child support to the parent the child lives with.</li>
        <li>If the judge used 27% of adjusted income instead  of 20%, the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge misapplied Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived some  material fact or proposition of law. This means the judge got an important fact  wrong.
      <p class = "example">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The parents agree that mom makes $25,000 every  year. They file the forms to tell the judge they agree. The judge calculated  child support using $35,000 for mom's income. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge used the wrong income to calculate  child support.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived a material  question in the case. This means the judge misunderstood what you were asking for.
      <p class = "example">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A child changed from living full time with their  mom to living full time with their dad. Under the child support formula, dad  used to pay child support to mom based on the primary custody child support  calculation. Now, mom should pay child support to dad based on the primary  custody child support calculation. Dad filed a motion to modify child support.  The judge denied dad's motion because the parents' incomes did not change.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state the judge did not include the changed parenting  schedule in the child support calculation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later  court decision or statute. This means the judge used a rule or law that  changed.
      <p class = "example">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to  allow a parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their  gross income, up to 10% of the parent's gross income.</li>
        <li>If the judge calculated child support on April  14 and did not subtract the cost of the parent's health insurance, the Motion  to Reconsider would explain the cost of the parent's health insurance and state  that Civil Rule 90.3 changed on April 15, 2018.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

content: |
  Changing your parenting plan or child support order is called "modifying" it. To ask the judge to change your order, file a **Motion to Modify**.
  
  The courts want children to have a regular schedule without a lot of changes. The courts will generally only change a parenting plan if there is a "substantial change in circumstances." A "substantial change in circumstances" means something has happened so that the old custody or parenting plan is no longer in the children's best interest.

  <div class="step-subheading">Some examples</div>
  <ul>
  <li>The current parenting plan order started when your child was an infant. They move between parents at noon Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Your child is starting kindergarten so the current schedule will not work.</li>
  <li>Under the current parenting plan order, your children spend one week with you and the next week with the other parent.  You are going to move out of state so the current schedule is impossible.</li>
  <li>Your children spend overnights with you and the other parent.  The other parent just went to jail for 2 years so the existing schedule is impossible.</li>
  <li>There was a new act of domestic violence between you and the other parent when you were exchanging the children.</li>
  </ul>
  % if user_need == 'change foreign custody order' or middle_of_case == 'no':

  Figure out the new child support amount using the new schedule and any new income information.  
    
    1. Calculate the percent of overnights your children spend with you and with the other parent. To get this percent, divide 365 (the number of overnights in a year), by the number of overnights the child spends with each parent.
  
  <strong>For example</strong>
  
  If your child spends 4 nights each week with you and 3 nights each week with their other parent, they spend 209 overnights each year with you and 156 nights each year with the other parent.
  
  209 divided by 365 nights in a year is .57, or 57% of overnights with you.
  
  156 divided by 365 nights in a year is .43, or 43% of overnights with the other parent.

    2. Use the percentages to fill out the <strong>Child Support Guidelines Affidavit, <a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-305.pdf">DR-305</a></strong>. Read [How to Fill out the Child Support Guidelines Affidavit](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-dr305f-sample.pdf) to help you fill out this form.
    3. The <strong>Child Support Guidelines Affidavit</strong> gives you the new child support amount for a <strong>primary custody child support</strong> schedule. A primary custody child support schedule is when the children spend 256 or more overnights with one parent. If you do not have a primary custody child support schedule, use one of these forms:
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Shared Custody Support Calculation, DR-306</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-306.pdf">Fill-In PDF</a>]<br>
  Use this if the children spend at least 110 overnights with each parent.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Custody Child Support Calculation, DR-308</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-308.pdf">Fill-In PDF</a>] Use this if both parents have shared custody of 1 or more children and 1 or both parents have primary custody of 1 or more children.</li>
  <li><strong>Divided Custody Child Support Calculation, DR-307</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-307.pdf">Fill-In PDF</a>] Use this if both parents have primary physical custody of one or more children and neither parent has shared custody of any children.</li>
  </ul>

  Step ${ dont_wait_modify_custody_divorce_idx }: Do not wait to file your Motion to Modify 
content: |
  If you and the other parent agree to change the schedule, or have already permanently changed your schedule, file your **[Uncontested Motion to Modify Custody](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcforms.htm#shc-pac11)** as soon as you can.  
  
  Until you file your motion with the court, **the parent who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order**. 
  
  **For example**
  <ul>
  <li>Under your current order, the children spend Sunday to Friday with you and Friday after school until Sunday after dinner with the other parent.</li>
  <li>Child support was calculated based on the children being with you 5 overnights each week, and with the other parent 2 overnights each week.</li>
  <li>You decide to change to a schedule where the children will spend a week with you and then a week with the other parent.  You start March 1.</li>
  <li>Child support will probably change because the percentage of overnights the children spend with each parent has changed.</li>
  <li>You file an <strong>Uncontested Motion to Modify Custody and Child Support</strong> June 21.</li>
  <li>The judge agrees with your motion and signs a new custody and child support order September 1.</li>
  <li>The new order says that the new child support amount starts July 1.</li>
  <li>Because you did not file your motion until June, the <strong>original</strong> child support amount still applies from March until July 1.</li>
  </ul>

  Step ${ compare_child_support_idx }: Compare the new calculation with the current amount
content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>Compare your current child support to the new amount to see if there is a "material change in circumstances"</div>
    If the new child support amount is 15% more or less than the old amount, there is a presumption that there is a material change in circumstances.
    
   <strong>For example</strong>
   
   If the old child support amount was $100 per month, there would be a material change if the new amount is:
    * $85 or less, or
    * $115 or more.

  Step ${ dont_wait_modify_child_support_idx }: Do not wait to file your Motion to Modify 
content: |
  File your <strong>Motion to Modify Child Support</strong> and give the other parent a copy of your motion as soon as you can after there is a “material change of circumstances.”

  Until you file your motion with the court, <strong>the parent who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order</strong>. 
  
  If the judge agrees to change the amount of your child support, the judge will sign a new child support order.  The new order includes the date the amount changed. This date is usually in the past. It will not be earlier than the date you filed your motion and gave a copy to the other parent.

  <strong>For example</strong>

    * The other parent gets a new job making a lot more money on March 1.
    * You recalculate child support.  The other parent will owe you more child support each month.
    * You file a motion to modify child support with the court and give the other parent a copy June 21.
    * The judge agrees to change your child support and grants your motion.
    * The judge signs a new child support order on September 1.
    * The court cannot order child support to be changed before you filed your motion and gave a copy to the other parent.
    * The new order says that the new child support amount starts July 1.
    * Because you did not file your motion until June, the other parent only has to pay the old amount of child support from March 1 to July 1.

  An appeal is the way to ask the Alaska Supreme Court to review the trial judge’s decision in your case.
  
  % if user_need == 'change custody order' or (user_need == 'change divorce order' and type_of_final_order.all_true('custody order', exclusive = True) and why_change == 'problem'):
  You have only 15 days from the day the court sent the order to you.
  % else: 
  You have only 30 days from the day the court sent the order to you.
  % endif
  
  If you cannot file on time, call the Appellate Courts Customer Service: (907) 264-0612. They may be able to help you file late.
  
  An appeal is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information.  In an appeal you argue that the trial judge made a legal mistake.  The civil appeals process is complicated, long and expensive. The process can take more than 2 years. [Talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsresources.htm#1), if you can.
  
  The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:
  
  * the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * the documents in the lower court or agency record, and
  * appeal briefs filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court. 
  
  To start an appeal, you must pay:
  
  * a $250 filing fee,
  * a $750 bond or deposit for costs, and
  * other costs like paying someone to make a transcript of your trial.
  
  If you cannot afford the cost of filing an Appeal, you can use **Motion for Waiver of Filing Fees and Costs, [SHS-AP 130](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/docs/SHS_AP_130.doc)** to ask the court to waive the filing fee and costs.
