  Step ${ learn_reconsider_idx }: Learn about Motions to Reconsider
content: |
  <p>To ask your trial judge to reconsider a  decision, file a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong></p>
  <p>You have only 10 days after the date the  court sent your child support order to you. </p>
  <p>Look at the last page of the order. The date  to count from is in the box at the bottom of the page. The box looks something  like this.</p>
  
  [FILE CertOfDistrAnnotated.png, 100%, This is a screenshot of the box that shows the date the court sent your order to you.]
  
  <p> If the 10th day is a  weekend or holiday, your motion is due the next day the court is open.  For example, if the 10th day is a Saturday,  and the court is open Monday, your motion is due Monday.  If Monday is a holiday, your motion is due  Tuesday.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>You can ask a judge to reconsider  their decision for 4 reasons </div>
  <ol>
    <li>The judge overlooked, misapplied or failed to  consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. This means the  judge made a mistake when they applied the law in your case.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rule 90.3 states that if a child spends at least  256 nights with one parent, that parent has primary custody and the other  parent  pays 20% of their adjusted annual  income for child support to the parent the child lives with. .</li>
        <li>If the judge used 27% of adjusted income instead  of 20%, the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge misapplied Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived some  material fact or proposition of law. This means the judge got an important fact  wrong.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The parents agree that mom makes $25,000 every  year. They file the forms to tell the judge they agree. The judge calculated  child support using $35,000 for mom's income. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge used the wrong income to calculate  child support.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived a material  question in the case. This means the judge misunderstood what you were asking for.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A child changed from living full time with their  mom to living full time with their dad. Under the child support formula, dad  used to pay child support to mom based on the primary custody child support  calculation. Now, mom should pay child support to dad based on the primary  custody child support calculation. Dad filed a motion to modify child support.  The judge denied dad's motion because the parents' incomes did not change.  </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state the judge did not include the changed parenting  schedule in the child support calculation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later  court decision or statute. This means the judge used a rule or law that  changed.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>On April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to  allow a parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their  gross income, up to 10% of the parent's gross income.</li>
        <li>If the judge calculated child support on April  14 and did not subtract the cost of the parent's health insurance, the Motion  to Reconsider would explain the cost of the parent's health insurance and state  that Civil Rule 90.3 changed on April 15, 2018.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>See <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf">Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure</a> 77(k) to read the court rules about the <strong>4 reasons</strong> you can ask the court to reconsider a judge's decision:</p>

  Step ${ expect_reconsider_idx }: What to expect after you file a Motion to Reconsider 
content: |
  <p>A <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> is different from other motions.</p>
  <p>The other parent does not have to respond unless the judge sends  a notice and asks the other parent to respond in writing.</p>
  <p> If the judge agrees to reconsider their decision, they may ask  the other parent to respond in writing or they may change the decision.  Usually, the judge only changes their  decision after they ask the other parent for a written response.</p>
  <p>If the judge does nothing for 30 days, it  means the judge is not going to grant your <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong>. You will not get anything in writing</a>. The original decision is not changed.</p>
  <p>The 30 days starts when  you file your <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong>.  If the judge asks the other parent to respond in writing, the 30 days starts  over when the other parent files their written response.</p>

  Step ${ learn_set_aside_idx }: Learn about Motions to Set Aside
content: |
  <p>A <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong> asks the judge to</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set aside or undo the final child support  decision in your case, and </li>
    <li>Start the child support part of your case over  again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Judges rarely agree to do this.</p>
  <p>Civil Rule 60(a) and (b) describe the  reasons you can use to file this motion. You may decide to file a <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong> if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The final order has a problem listed in Civil  Rule 60(a) or (b). The problems are  described below. And</li>
    <li>You can file within a &quot;reasonable  time&quot; after the date the court sent your child support order to you. For any of the first 3 reasons in Civil Rule  60(b), you must file within <strong>1 year</strong> of the date the court sent the order to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The date the court sent the order to you is  in the box at the bottom of the last page of your order.</p>
  [FILE CertOfDistrAnnotated.png, 100%, This is a screenshot of the box that shows the date the court sent your order to you.]
  <p>Act quickly! The judge defines  &quot;reasonable&quot; and "in a reasonable time&quot;. The judge  may refuse to set aside the order if you file <strong>after</strong> a &quot;reasonable time&quot; has passed, even if your reason  for filing is a good one.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Reasons you may file a Motion to Set Aside  Judgment or Order</div>
  <p><strong>Civil Rule 60(a)</strong> <br>
    The  court made a clerical mistake or accidentally left something out of a document. </p>
  <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The order has the wrong birthday for one of your  children. Or</li>
    <li>The order was sent to both parents on January 4, <strong>2023</strong>, but the date on the order is  January 4, <strong>2022</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Civil  Rule 60(b)</strong></p>
  <p>The court made a mistake listed below.</p>
  <p>For the first 3 types of mistake, you must file your <strong>Motion to Set Aside</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Within <strong>1 year</strong> of the date the court sent  the order to you, <strong>and</strong></li>
    <li>The amount of time before you file must be  &quot;reasonable."</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Inadvertence,  surprise or excusable neglect:
      <ul>
        <li>A parent made a mistake or did not pay close  attention -inadvertence,</li>
        <li>An unexpected action, sudden confusion or an  unanticipated event - surprise, or </li>
        <li>A legitimate excuse for failing to take required  action - excusable neglect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>You ask the judge to set aside the decision  made at a hearing you missed because: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You had a heart attack the day before, and </li>
        <li>You were in the ICU, so you could not attend.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Newly  discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by taking reasonable  steps within the 10 days allowed to request a new trial.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gave your spouse $1,000 before the trial to pay the property  taxes on your marital home, and</li>
        <li>1 month after trial you learn your spouse did not pay the taxes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fraud,  misrepresentation, or other misconduct from the other side.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>One spouse forges an appraisal of the marital home and uses it as  evidence at the divorce trial to argue the value of the house.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For  the next 3 types of mistake, the amount of time before you file must be  &quot;reasonable."</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The judgment is  void.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>An Alaska court generally does not have the authority or  &quot;jurisdiction&quot; to make a parenting  plan for a child who has lived in another state for the past 6 or more  months.  </li>
        <li>If a child was living in Oregon for 6 months before the divorce  case started, and</li>
        <li>A parent hid this detail from the other parent and the court, </li>
        <li>The parenting plan order would be void because the court did not  have jurisdiction to decide the parenting plan.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judgment has been satisfied, released or  discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or  otherwise vacated or it is no longer fair that the judgment should apply at  this time.
      <p><strong>For  example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The court orders a parent to pay child support. The child files  for Emancipation and the judge grants it. Parents do not have to support their  emancipated child. The child support judgment   would be released or discharged.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Any  other reason justifying relief from the judgment.
      <ul>
        <li> You may be able to come up with a different good reason the judge should  start the case over again. But your reason cannot be any of the 6 listed above – it must be  something different.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
