  Step ${ ak_jurisdiction_idx }: Make sure that the Alaska court has the authority to change the order
content: |
  <ul>
  <li>A court must have the authority called jurisdiction to issue an order about a custody or parenting plan or a child support order.</li>
  <li>Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months can make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's &quot;home state.&quot;</li>
  <li>Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state." This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months. <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm">Talking to a lawyer</a> can help you decide which is the best state for your case.</li>

  Step ${ parents_agree_idx }: Find out if you and ${ other_party_in_case } agree
content: |
  <p>If you want to change an order in your ${ case_type } case, you can talk with ${ other_party_in_case }. See if you agree about the change or if you both want to try to reach an agreement one of these ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk more with each other until you can agree.</li>
    <li>Mediation.</li>
    <li>Collaborative Law.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk with ${ other_party_in_case } about settling your case without a trial</div>
  <p>Some people are able to talk to each other and agree about the issues they need to work out. They do not need a judge to decide for them. Sometimes a friend or family member can help you figure out an agreement.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  <p>Mediation is an informal, voluntary, and confidential way   to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone   else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.</li>
    <li>Explain and understand each other's needs.</li>
    <li>Clear up misunderstandings.</li>
    <li>Explore creative solutions. And</li>
    <li>Reach acceptable agreements.</li>
  </ul>

  Alaska courts offer mediation in cases in which parents need to create a parenting plan. The mediator helps parents resolve disputes about access and visitation concerns and create workable co-parenting plans. There is no fee for this service unless parents wish to mediate additional issues or require more time than allowed by program.

  Use **Request for Court-Sponsored Parenting Plan Dispute Resolution, MED-405** [[Fill-in PDF](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/med-405.pdf)] to request mediation.
  
  <p>You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.  </p>
  [Read about mediation](https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation).
  
  [Find a private mediator](https://www.alaskamediators.org/directory) on the Professional Mediators of  Alaska website. 

  <div class="step-subheading">Collaborative Law</div>
  <p>The <strong>Alaska Association of Collaborative Professionals</strong> helps people resolve parenting issues outside of the court process without a judge making decisions.  Learn more about the Association on <a href="https://www.alaskacollaborative.org">their website</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="step-subheading">If you both agree, you can change some things on your own</div>
  <ul>
    <li>You do not have to tell the court about every change you make. But you must tell the court about <strong>some</strong> changes. If you make a small change, like changing pick-up time by an hour, or a change to your holiday schedule, you do not have to tell the court.</li>
    <li>If you make a change about something big, like changing the parenting schedule from weekends with one parent to week on / week off, you must tell the court in writing.</li>
    <li>If you want to be sure that both of you must follow the new agreement, tell the court so the judge can make the agreement part of your court order.</li>
    <li>If you want to change child support because the parenting schedule or a parent's income changes, you must tell the court in writing so the judge can decide if the child support amount should change.  The parent who owes money under the child support order you want to change continues to owe that amount until the judge signs a new order.</li>
    <li>Be sure you agree with the change before sending it to the judge. If you tell the court you agree to a change and the judge signs the agreement, it is a new court order and you are required to follow it. It can only be changed if:
    <ul>
      <li>You and ${ other_party_in_case } later agree to a new change. Or</li>
      <li>You or ${ other_party_in_case } follow all the steps to ask the judge to change the order, and the judge agrees and signs a new order.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

For process servers outside Alaska, contact the local court where ${other_party_in_case} lives, or do internet research.
    * Fill out the form **Service Instructions**, [CIV-615](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-615.pdf). Give this form to the process server so that when they complete service, you will receive a **Proof of Service** form.
    * If you hire a process service outside Alaska, give them the **Return of Service, SHC-194** [Word](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-193.doc) | [PDF](http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-193n.pdf).

  <strong>Alternate service</strong>
  If you cannot find ${other_party_in_case}, you may ask the court for permission to serve ${other_party_in_case} in a different way. For example, you can ask to post on the court’s legal notice website, post to someone’s social media account, email, publish in a newspaper that ${other_party_in_case} reads or post at a shelter or some other location ${other_party_in_case} is known to frequent.

  Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one court has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.

  Only filing for custody, answering custody and answering divorce have this paternity_step. 
  Child support has its own paternity_step which has different content and needs to be renamed.

  <div class='step-subheading'>General Paternity Information</div>
  Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological  father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial  outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are. Once established, the father's name can be  placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial  responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's  biological father.

  You can prove or disprove paternity several ways:
  
  <ul>
    <li> Each  parent signs an affidavit stating the biological father.  Fill out:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Three-Way  Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151</strong> <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc">Word</a> | <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf">Fill-in PDF</a>,</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The  mother, child, and person who may be the father take a DNA test using a  painless swab inside the cheek. The whole process takes about 15 minutes and  the result is ready within about 3 weeks.

  <div class='step-subheading'>Change the Birth Certificate</div>
  If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the  Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate. 
  
  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered &quot;legitimated&quot; and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on  military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's  Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.
