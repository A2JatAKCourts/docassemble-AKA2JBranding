  Step ${ ak_jurisdiction_idx }: Make sure that the Alaska court has the authority to change the order
content: |
  <ul>
  <li>A court must have the authority called jurisdiction to issue an order about a custody or parenting plan or a child support order.</li>
  <li>Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months can make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's &quot;home state.&quot;</li>
  <li>Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state." This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months. <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm">Talking to a lawyer</a> can help you decide which is the best state for your case.</li>

  Step ${ parents_agree_idx }: Find out if you and ${ other_party_in_case } agree
content: |
  <p>If you want to change an order in your ${ case_type } case, you can talk with ${ other_party_in_case }. See if you agree about the change or if you both want to try to reach an agreement one of these ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk more with each other until you can agree.</li>
    <li>Mediation.</li>
    <li>Collaborative Law.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="step-subheading">Talk with ${ other_party_in_case } about settling your case without a trial</div>
  <p>Some people are able to talk to each other and agree about the issues they need to work out. They do not need a judge to decide for them. Sometimes a friend or family member can help you figure out an agreement.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">Mediation</div>
  <p>Mediation is an informal, voluntary, and confidential way   to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone   else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.</li>
    <li>Explain and understand each other's needs.</li>
    <li>Clear up misunderstandings.</li>
    <li>Explore creative solutions. And</li>
    <li>Reach acceptable agreements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case.  If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.  <br>
    <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation">Read about mediation</a>.</p>
    
  <div class="step-subheading">Collaborative Law</div>
  <p>The <strong>Alaska Association of Collaborative Professionals</strong> helps people resolve parenting issues outside of the court process without a judge making decisions.  Learn more about the Association on <a href="https://www.alaskacollaborative.org">their website</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="step-subheading">If you both agree, you can change some things on your own</div>
  <ul>
    <li>You do not have to tell the court about every change you make. But you must tell the court about <strong>some</strong> changes. If you make a small change, like changing pick-up time by an hour, or a change to your holiday schedule, you do not have to tell the court.</li>
    <li>If you make a change about something big, like changing the parenting schedule from weekends with one parent to week on / week off, you must tell the court in writing.</li>
    <li>If you want to be sure that both of you must follow the new agreement, tell the court so the judge can make the agreement part of your court order.</li>
    <li>If you want to change child support because the parenting schedule or a parent's income changes, you must tell the court in writing so the judge can decide if the child support amount should change.  The parent who owes money under the child support order you want to change continues to owe that amount until the judge signs a new order.</li>
  </ul>

  Figure out the new child support amount using the new schedule and any new income information.  
    
    <ol>
    <li><p>Calculate the percent of overnights your children spend with you and with the other parent. To get this percent, divide 365 (the number of overnights in a year), by the number of overnights the child spends with each parent.</p>
  
  <div class = "example">
      <p class = "heading">For example</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If your child spends 4 nights each week with you and 3 nights each week with their other parent, they spend 209 overnights each year with you and 156 nights each year with the other parent.</li>  
  <li>209 divided by 365 nights in a year is .57, or 57% of overnights with you.</li>
  <li>156 divided by 365 nights in a year is .43, or 43% of overnights with the other parent.</li>
