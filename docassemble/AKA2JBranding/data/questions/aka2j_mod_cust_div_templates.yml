  Step ${ standing_order_idx }: Ask the court to change the Standing Order or a similar decision
content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  
    When your case was opened, the court issued an order, usually called a **Standing Order** or a **Domestic Relations Procedural Order (DRPO)**.
    
  % if user_need == 'change divorce order':
  The court expects both spouses to follow the order.
  % else:
  The court expects both parents to follow the order.
  % endif
  
  Sometimes you or ${other_party_in_case} wants to do something the **Standing Order** does not allow.
  
  For example, you may want to take your children to a family reunion in another state. But the **Standing Order** says parents cannot remove the children from Alaska during the case.
  % if user_need == 'change divorce order':
  
  The **Standing Order** or **(DRPO)** in a divorce case also says your spouse must agree or you must get permission from the court to:
  
  * sell marital property, or
  * cancel or change the terms of any insurance policy.
  % endif
  
  If you want to do something different from what the order allows, you can ask ${other_party_in_case} to agree to it.
  
  If they do not agree, you can ask the court to change the order by filing a "motion."

content: |
  % if  type_of_interim_order == 'motion':
  If you or your spouse filed a motion and the judge made an interim order, but things have changed,  you can file another motion.
  Tell the judge what has changed and why you need a new order.
  % else:
  A motion is the way to ask the court to order something.

  Step ${ foreign_order_idx }: Ask the court to change your custody and Parenting Plan or child support order from another state
content: |
  
  <p>There are 3 steps to ask an Alaska court to change a custody and parenting plan or child support order from another state:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Make sure the Alaska court has jurisdiction (authority) to change the order. See Step ${ ak_jurisdiction_idx }.</li>
  <li>Register the out-of-state order in Alaska. See Step ${ register_order_idx }.</li>
  <li>Ask the Alaska court to change the order by filing a Motion to Modify. See Step ${ modify_idx }.</li>
  </ol>

  Step ${ ak_jurisdiction_idx }: Make sure that the Alaska court has the authority to change the order
content: |
  <ul>
  <li>A court must have the authority called jurisdiction to issue an order about a custody or parenting plan or a child support order.</li>
  <li>Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months can make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's &quot;home state.&quot;</li>
  <li>Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state." This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months. <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm">Talking to a lawyer</a> can help you decide which is the best state for your case.</li>
