  Step ${ standing_order_idx }: Ask the court to change the Standing Order or a similar order
content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Background</div>
  
    When your case was opened, the court issued an order, usually called a **Standing Order** or a **Domestic Relations Procedural Order (DRPO)**.
    
  % if user_need == 'change divorce order':
  The court expects both spouses to follow the order.
  % else:
  The court expects both parents to follow the order.
  % endif
  
  Sometimes you or ${other_party_in_case} wants to do something the **Standing Order** does not allow.
  
  For example, you may want to take your children to a family reunion in another state. But the **Standing Order** says parents cannot remove the children from Alaska during the case.
  % if user_need == 'change divorce order':
  
  The **Standing Order** or **(DRPO)** in a divorce case also says your spouse must agree or you must get permission from the court to:
  
  * sell marital property, or
  * cancel or change the terms of any insurance policy.
  % endif
  
  If you want to do something different from what the order allows, you can ask ${other_party_in_case} to agree to it.
  
  If they do not agree, you can ask the court to change the order by filing a "motion."

  <p>To ask your judge to reconsider a decision, file a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong></p>
  <p>You have only 10 days after the date the court sent your ${ case_type } order to you. </p>

  <p> If the <strong>10th</strong> day is a  weekend or holiday, your motion is due the next day the court is open. For example, if the 10th day is a Saturday,  and the court is open Monday, your motion is due Monday. If Monday is a holiday, your motion is due Tuesday.</p>
  <div class="step-subheading">You can ask a judge to reconsider their decision for 4 reasons</div>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The judge overlooked, misapplied or failed to  consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. This means the  judge made a mistake when they applied the law in your case.<p>
      <div class = "example">
      <p class = "heading">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rule 90.3 states that if a child spends at least  256 nights with one parent, that parent has primary custody and the other  parent pays 20% of their adjusted annual  income for child support to the parent the child lives with.</li>
        <li>If the judge used 27% of adjusted income instead  of 20%, the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge misapplied Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><p>The judge overlooked or misconceived some  material fact or proposition of law. This means the judge got an important fact  wrong.</p>
      <div class = "example">
      <p class = "heading">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The parents agree that mom makes $25,000 every  year. They file the forms to tell the judge they agree. The judge calculated  child support using $35,000 for mom's income. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge used the wrong income to calculate  child support.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><p>The judge overlooked or misconceived a material  question in the case. This means the judge misunderstood what you were asking for.</p>
      <div class = "example">
      <p class = "heading">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A child changed from living full time with their  mom to living full time with their dad. Under the child support formula, dad  used to pay child support to mom based on the primary custody child support  calculation. Now, mom should pay child support to dad based on the primary  custody child support calculation. Dad filed a motion to modify child support.  The judge denied dad's motion because the parents' incomes did not change.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state the judge did not include the changed parenting  schedule in the child support calculation.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><p>The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later  court decision or statute. This means the judge used a rule or law that  changed.</p>
      <div class = "example">
      <p class = "heading">For example</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to  allow a parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their  gross income, up to 10% of the parent's gross income.</li>
        <li>If the judge calculated child support on April  14 and did not subtract the cost of the parent's health insurance, the Motion  to Reconsider would explain the cost of the parent's health insurance and state  that Civil Rule 90.3 changed on April 15, 2018.</li>

  Changing your parenting plan or child support order is called "modifying" it. To ask the judge to change your order, file a **Motion to Modify**.
  % elif user_need in('respond to motion in custody', 'respond to motion in divorce'):
  Your judge will decide the motion based on ${ other_party_in_case }'s request, your response, and the law. Learning about the law can help you decide what to write in your response.

  The courts want children to have a regular schedule without a lot of changes. The courts will generally only change a parenting plan if there is a "substantial change in circumstances." A "substantial change in circumstances" means something has happened so that the old custody or parenting plan is no longer in the children's best interest.

  <div class="step-subheading">Some examples</div>
  <ul>
  <li>The current parenting plan order started when your child was an infant. They move between parents at noon Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Your child is starting kindergarten so the current schedule will not work.</li>
  <li>Under the current parenting plan order, your children spend one week with you and the next week with the other parent.  You are going to move out of state so the current schedule is impossible.</li>
  <li>Your children spend overnights with you and the other parent.  The other parent just went to jail for 2 years so the existing schedule is impossible.</li>
  <li>There was a new act of domestic violence between you and the other parent when you were exchanging the children.</li>
  </ul>
  % if user_need == 'change foreign custody order' or (not user_need in('respond to motion in custody', 'respond to motion in divorce') and middle_of_case == 'no'):
  The court charges $75 to file this motion. If you cannot afford the fee, you may be able to get the court to waive it. See the Step ${ file_motion_idx }: ${ file_step_heading }.
  % endif
  
  If the judge decides there is a substantial change of circumstances, the judge will order a new parenting plan in the children's best interest.
  
  If the judge changes the parenting plan, the judge may issue a new child support order.
  % endif
  
  % if  user_need == 'respond to motion in divorce' and type_of_response == 'modify' and type_of_modification['child support'] and not type_of_modification['custody']:
  The child support rule, [Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure 90.3](https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf), states you need to prove there has been a “material change in circumstances” to modify child support. The most common changes in circumstances are:
  
  * Your children's schedule changes and they spend more or fewer overnights with you than they used to, or
  * Your income or the other parent's income changes.
  
  There needs to be:
  
  * A 15% change in the amount of child support ordered. So that when you calculate support based on the parents' current income, the amount is 15% more or less than the current support order.
  
  Or
  
  *	A change in the parenting plan that affects the child support formula. For example, changing from a primary custody to shared custody plan will probably change the amount of child support.
  
  If the judge decides there is a material change of circumstances, the judge will calculate a new child support order.
  % endif
  The Alaska Supreme Court has issued many [decisions](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shclaws.htm#cases) about what types of circumstances amount to a change of circumstances allowing a modification.

  <p>A court will rarely grant a <strong>Motion to Modify </strong>made within 15 days of when the court made its final custody order unless something unexpected happened. Examples of why a court may grant a <strong>Motion to Modify</strong> are listed below.

  If you and the other parent agree to change the schedule, or have already permanently changed your schedule, file your **[Uncontested Motion to Modify Custody](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcforms.htm#shc-pac11)** as soon as you can.  
  
  <p>Until you file your motion with the court, <strong>the parent who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order</strong>.</p>
  
  <div class = "example">
      <p class = "heading">For example</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Under your current order, the children spend Sunday to Friday with you and Friday after school until Sunday after dinner with the other parent.</li>
  <li>Child support was calculated based on the children being with you 5 overnights each week, and with the other parent 2 overnights each week.</li>
  <li>You decide to change to a schedule where the children will spend a week with you and then a week with the other parent.  You start March 1.</li>
  <li>Child support will probably change because the percentage of overnights the children spend with each parent has changed.</li>
  <li>You file an <strong>Uncontested Motion to Modify Custody and Child Support</strong> June 21.</li>
  <li>The judge agrees with your motion and signs a new custody and child support order September 1.</li>
  <li>The new order says that the new child support amount starts July 1.</li>
  <li>Because you did not file your motion until June, the <strong>original</strong> child support amount still applies from March until July 1.</li>

  <div class="step-subheading">Compare your current child support to the new amount to see if there is a "material change in circumstances"</div>
    If the new child support amount is 15% more or less than the old amount, there is a presumption that there is a material change in circumstances.
    
   <strong>For example</strong>
   
   If the old child support amount was $100 per month, there would be a material change if the new amount is:
    * $85 or less, or
    * $115 or more.

  Step ${ dont_wait_modify_child_support_idx }: Do not wait to file your Motion to Modify 
content: |
  File your <strong>Motion to Modify Child Support</strong> and give the other parent a copy of your motion as soon as you can after there is a “material change of circumstances.”

  Until you file your motion with the court, <strong>the parent who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order</strong>. 
  
  If the judge agrees to change the amount of your child support, the judge will sign a new child support order.  The new order includes the date the amount changed. This date is usually in the past. It will not be earlier than the date you filed your motion and gave a copy to the other parent.

  <strong>For example</strong>

    * The other parent gets a new job making a lot more money on March 1.
    * You recalculate child support.  The other parent will owe you more child support each month.
    * You file a motion to modify child support with the court and give the other parent a copy June 21.
    * The judge agrees to change your child support and grants your motion.
    * The judge signs a new child support order on September 1.
    * The court cannot order child support to be changed before you filed your motion and gave a copy to the other parent.
    * The new order says that the new child support amount starts July 1.
    * Because you did not file your motion until June, the other parent only has to pay the old amount of child support from March 1 to July 1.

  Step ${ appeal_idx }: Decide if you want to file an appeal
content: |
  An appeal is the way to ask the Alaska Supreme Court to review the trial judge’s decision in your case.
  
  % if user_need == 'change custody order' or (user_need == 'change divorce order' and type_of_final_order.all_true('custody order', exclusive = True) and why_change == 'problem'):
  You have only **15 days** from the day the court sent the order to you.
  % else: 
  You have only **30 days** from the day the court sent the order to you.
  % endif
  
  If you cannot file on time, call the Appellate Courts Customer Service: (907) 264-0612. They may be able to help you file late.
  
  An appeal is not a new trial or a chance to give a judge new evidence or information.  In an appeal you argue that the trial judge made a legal mistake.  The civil appeals process is complicated, long and expensive. The process can take more than 2 years. [Talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/appealsresources.htm#1), if you can.
  
  The only information the Supreme Court looks at is:
  
  * the audio recording of the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * any items offered as evidence at the hearing or trial in the lower court,
  * the documents in the lower court or agency record, and
  * appeal briefs filed in the appeal to the Supreme Court. 
  
  To start an appeal, you must pay:
  
  * a $250 filing fee,
  * a $750 bond or deposit for costs, and
  * other costs like paying someone to make a transcript of your trial.
  
  If you cannot afford the cost of filing an Appeal, you can use **Motion for Waiver of Filing Fees and Costs, [SHS-AP 130](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/appeals/docs/SHS_AP_130.doc)** to ask the court to waive the filing fee and costs.

  Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one court has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
  
  If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
  
  Pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
  
  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.
